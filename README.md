# RAG_based_Chatbot-Company-Policy-
Objective:
Build a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) chatbot that can answer questions related to company
policies.
LLMs, embeddings, and vector databases 

1. At first I have created 4 file of company policy: HR Policy, IT Policy, Leave Policy and Remote Work Policy. So that, our chatbot can retrive data from this files upon asking queries, then will generate answers from these.
2. The installed needed dependencies and libraries; like langchain which help to connect LLMs
3. Then load the data and split into chuncks for better retrieval.
4. Create Embeddings and FAISS Vector Database
5. Loaded a small model Flan-T5 (No API key needed)
6. Built a RAG chain and memory setup.
7. Lastly integrated StreamLit

I have attached some screenshots after running the application.
